# DataSet Used

The dataset used in this project contains information on 5000 movies, including various details such as genre, cast, crew, and more. This dataset serves as the foundation for the analysis helps in building recommendation system

# Types of Recommendation Systems

In this project, we utilize Content-Based Filtering recommendation systems to provide personalized recommendations to users. 
The main types of recommendation systems implemented are:

## Content-Based Filtering:
Content-based filtering methods are based on the description of a product and a profile of the user’s preferred choices. In this recommendation system, products are described using keywords, and a user profile is built to express the kind of item this user likes.
**For instance, if a user likes to watch movies such as Iron Man, the recommender system recommends movies of the superhero genre or films describing Tony Stark.**

## Collaborative Filtering:
The collaborative filtering method is based on gathering and analyzing data on user’s behavior. This includes the user’s online activities and predicting what they will like based on the similarity with other users.For example, if user A likes Apple, Banana, and Mango while user B likes Apple, Banana, and Jackfruit, they have similar interests. So, it is highly likely that A would like Jackfruit and B would enjoy Mango. This is how collaborative filtering takes place.

## Hybrid Recommendation Systems:**
 In hybrid recommendation systems, products are recommended using both content-based and collaborative filtering simultaneously to suggest a broader range of products to customers. This recommendation system is up-and-coming and is said to provide more accurate recommendations than other recommender systems.

# Cosine Similarity

Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure the similarity between two vectors in a multi-dimensional space. It calculates the cosine of the angle between these vectors, which is a measure of how closely they align with each other. for better understanding , please refer
